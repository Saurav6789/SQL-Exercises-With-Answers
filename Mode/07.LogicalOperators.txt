Each logical operator is a special snowflake, so we'll go through them individually in the following lessons. Here's a
quick preview:

- LIKE allows you to match similar values, instead of exact values.
- IN allows you to specify a list of values you'd like to include.
- BETWEEN allows you to select only rows within a certain range.
- IS NULL allows you to select rows that contain no data in a given column.
- AND allows you to select only rows that satisfy two conditions.
- OR allows you to select rows that satisfy either of two conditions.
- NOT allows you to select rows that do not match a certain condition.
